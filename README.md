## Multiple walker Particle Swarm Optimization Implementation for FF Parameterization

<p align="justify"> A Python implementation of a Multiple Walker Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for parameter optimization and tuning. </p>

### Overview
<p align="justify"> This repository contains a robust implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with multiple walker functionality. PSO is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. The algorithm is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. </p>

<p align="justify"> The multiple walker approach enhances the traditional PSO algorithm by employing several independent swarms (walkers) that explore the solution space simultaneously, improving convergence and helping avoid local optima. </p>
